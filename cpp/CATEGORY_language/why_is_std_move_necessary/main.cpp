This POC investigates why std::move is needed, if a function just uses an rvalue reference that it got as input.

What the POC defines :

- an overload-set of two function 'inspect' that behave differently if arg is an Lvalue or an Rvalue
- a function 'f' that expects an rvalue (vector<int>&&) as input, and calls inspect with it, WITHOUT moving it
- the main juste builds a vector<int>, moves it into the call of 'f'
- the purpose is to check if the overload with Rvalue or Lvalue is called
- a macro CHECK_VALUE_TYPE is used to see if 'items' is an lvalue or ravlue inside 'f'

What happens :
- if 'f' doesn't use std::move, the lvalue overload of 'inspect(items)' is called...
- ... even if 'items' is an rvalue-reference !
- this is even more confusing when the CHECK_VALUE_TYPE macro sees 'items' as an Rvalue !
- of course, if f uses move(items) (or static_cast<vector<int>>&&(items)), the proper rvalue overload is called

This (excellent) article has a sentence on this topic :
    http://bajamircea.github.io/coding/cpp/2016/04/07/move-forward.html
    But when used inside the function body, a parameter, whether lvalue reference or rvalue reference, is an lvalue itself: it has a name like any other variable.

But I'm confused : I would have expect that the macro returns 'LVALUE'...
My guess, is that decltype uses the passed parameter, and not the actual parameter.

Still, the rule-of-thumb remains : use std::move to pass a parameter by rvalue-ref (and don't use the object anymore).

Quote 1 : "Inside the function, the rvalue arguments create rvalue reference parameters, which are themselves lvalues as they are named!"
Quote 2 : "However, now the returned rvalue reference [returned from std::forward] doesnâ€™t have a name which makes it an rvalue!
